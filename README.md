Final Project Submission
Project Title
EcoTrack – Personal & Community Carbon Footprint Tracker
UN SDG Alignment
Primary: #13 Climate Action
Secondary: #11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, #12 Responsible Consumption and Production
Project Overview (Description)
EcoTrack is a mobile-first web app that empowers individuals and communities to measure, understand, and reduce their carbon footprint in a fun, social, and actionable way. Users log daily activities (transport, food, energy, shopping), instantly see their CO₂ impact with beautiful visualizations, receive personalized reduction tips, and join local “climate circles” to collectively track city-wide progress. The app turns climate action from an abstract concept into something measurable, motivating, and communal.
